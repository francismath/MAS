# Python-based-project-Multi-Agent-System
This project aims to explore the impact of aging on product price in goods market.
aging has two effects in the goods market: the shopping externality and consumption externality.
As the aged have more time and less time cost, they have the shopping propensity of searching more in the goods market, compared with that of labor force. 
Therefore, they are less likely to make a deal with a sellor at the first time they encounter a merchandise. Instead, they tend to search more about similar products 
and compare the prices as well as the quality and services.
Shopping externatily means the rise of the ratio of the retirees to labor force increases the proportion of pickier consumers in the goods market whereas consumption externality
simply implies that there will be more pure consumers whose main activities is to purchase rather than the combination of purchase and producing.

In this study, a theoretical model with 3 nonlinear equations was constructed to capture the charicteristic of the shopping propensity of the aged.
The empirical part was to compare the two effects and their comprehensive force to labor market.

Two methods were used to solve the nonlinear system: direct method using 'fsolve' in Python and Newton Raphson method.
